        <h2>Educational Journey</h2>
        <p>For my early education, I attended Dr. Peter Marshall Elementary School until the end of first grade. I moved after spending about two years at that school. I then transferred to Abraham Lincoln Elementary School, where I met a lot of my friends which I still talk to till this day. I completed all six years, from 2nd grade to 6th grade, at Abraham Lincoln.

            After finishing my elementary journey, I moved on to Sycamore Junior High School for two years, completing 8th grade during the pandemic. This brings me to today, my final year of high school.

    <h1>Career Aspirations and Future Plans</h1>
    <p>I plan on becoming a computer engineer in the future and for those of you who dont know what computer engineering is let me tell you about it.
        Computer engineering is a field that has revolutionized modern technology, making significant contributions to various industries such as healthcare, transportation, and finance.
        Computer engineering is a diverse field that combines principles from computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics to design and develop computer systems that are essential for daily operations in various industries.
        I intend to make society better with comupter engineering by using it to help solve environmental problems, health problems, and cyber security. </p>
